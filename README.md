# Work-Day-Schedule

## Description
Work Day Schedule was created to use and practice new skills I learnt at bootcamp. In this application I used JavaScript and third party API moment js.
Application shows current month, date, year and local time. It was designed for everyday use for a standart business day from 9am-5pm. Also, current hour is highlighted in red, past in grey and future in green colors. User is be able to enter an event to any field and save it to local storage. Event data will be saved and rendered next time user runs the app.
